    description: "Humans have longed for computers to take over and make the monotonous and tedious tasks obsolete. Artificial Intelligence(AI) is just the right answers to this problem. There are not one but many sectors that are being manipulated by this ever- growing technology. It is safe to say that each day machines are getting better at understanding humans which is due to the evolution and innovation in this field. In this paper, we have uncovered various sectors in which artificial intelligence along with its various branches like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning(ML) and Computer Vision have helped the world curate a better place by personalizing every daily use item. This has enhanced the way we live. However, there is a lot of data that is being used in order to bring these technologies to life. We have highlighted the constraints as well as the pleasures that this technology can bring us.",
